\title{Combine two (or more?) gene lists into a single integrated network}
\usage{
integrate_networks(df_list, col, order, ppi_data = innatedb_exp, seed = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{df_list}{List of data frames; data to be integrated into a single
network. If the list items do not have names, they will be assigned names
using \code{LETTERS}.}

\item{col}{Column containing Ensembl gene IDs; must be present in all
elements of \code{df_list}.}

\item{order}{Desired type of output network ("zero", "first", "min_simple" or
"min_steiner"); passed to \code{build_network()}}

\item{ppi_data}{Data frame of PPI data; must contain rows of interactions as
pairs of Ensembl gene IDs, with columns named "ensembl_gene_A" and
"ensembl_gene_B". Defaults to pre-packaged InnateDB PPI data.}

\item{seed}{Number used in call to \code{set.seed()} to allow for reproducible
network generation}
}
\value{
\code{tidygraph} object for plotting or further analysis
}

\details{
The "min_steiner" method is implemented with the \code{SteinerNet}
package.
