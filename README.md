### Functions for Reproducible PPI Network Creation and Visualization in R

A suite of functions to make it simple to construct PPI networks inside of R,
with an emphasis on usability and reproducibility.

## Installation
You can install `networker` with the following lines (assuming you have
`devtools` already installed):
```r
devtools::install_github("https://github.com/travis-m-blimkie/networker")
```

If you run into installation issues relating to the package `biomaRt` (which is
a dependency of `networker`), you can install it with the following:
```r
if (!require("BiocManager")) { # Optionally install BiocManager if needed
  install.packages("BiocManager")
}
BiocManager::install("biomaRt")
```
